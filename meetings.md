Avalanche framework
- has set of tasks
- you can specify the tasks sequence or just pure random
- when we do optimization, we put take sequence as an inputs
- old version of Avalanche can work
    - if you want use the newest version of the Avalanche, then we can do it
    - we need to run and compile new version of Avalanche in Argonne framework
    - Argonne Polaris is similar to Argonne Aurora
- let us create github repo and push the code
    - main thing we will need: couple the optimization framework such as DeepHyper
    - task variability that presents in the algorithm
    - very restricted on the subset of tasks
    - all documented algorithms performance are suffered from task sequence
    - how do we learn st we equip the network to reduce the variance of prediction
